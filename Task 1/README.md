The code used for both the lymphs are same. But there is a minor changes in the values due to the size of the svs files so I have created a seperate folder for each lymph. The given whole slide images are converted into tiles and saved in the internal storage(the error at the end of the code is due to the force stopping of the execution because the file size is very large).
